## YATKA
yet another tetris klone in action

### about
- gfx and code (mostly) by me
- background image taken from Berserk manga
- frame limiting, counting and upscaling code by Artur 'zear' Rojek
- arcade font by Yuji Adachi
- in-game music by Vomitron

### plans
- better scoring (T-spins, combos, etc.)
- optional easy spin implementation
- lock delay
- better wall kick
- better Bittboy's key mapping
