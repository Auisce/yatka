## YATKA
yet another tetris klone in action

### about
- gfx and code (mostly) by me
- background image taken from Berserk manga
- frame limiting, counting and upscaling code by Artur 'zear' Rojek
- arcade font by Yuji Adachi
- in-game music comes from [this site](http://www.keygenmusic.net/)
- game over sfx was found somewhere in the internet

### plans
- ghost piece implementation
- better scoring (T-spins, combos, etc.)
- using a proper library for sound playback
- optional easy spin implementation
- lock delay
- customizable number of next pieces
- better wall kick
